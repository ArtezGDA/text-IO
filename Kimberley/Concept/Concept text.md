The Concept is to make a program in the terminal.
This program will show you short motivational short messages hourly like: **"Good Job!"**,**"You can do this!"**,**"Awesome!"** and more. The program is dedicated to give people that ""little push in the back"". You can put these Motivational messages on (when you need them) and off (When you can handle it all by yourself) in your terminal. 

The text will be showed in the Notification Center, so you dont have to switch to the Terminal but it will show you


osascript -e 'display notification "Good Job!" with title "Motivation"'
osascript -e 'display notification "Awesome!" with title "Motivation"'
osascript -e 'display notification "You can do this!" with title "Motivation"'
