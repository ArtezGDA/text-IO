vol1.txt:unutterable horror at finding that the boat has been picked up and\

vol2.txt:howl--a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as\
vol2.txt:instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.\

vol2.txt:or death with its most hideous moral horrors. I had been reserved for\

vol2.txt:removed. I say to my horror; for I was consumed with intolerable thirst.\
vol2.txt:idea that had perceptibly descended. I now observed--with what horror it\
vol2.txt:agents--the pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant\
vol2.txt:What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than\
vol2.txt:my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when the\

vol2.txt:from Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.\
vol2.txt:astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then\
vol2.txt:horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than\
vol2.txt:dreams a cry as of horror and dismay; and thereunto, after a pause,\
vol2.txt:comprehension. Yet its memory was replete with horror--horror more\
vol2.txt:involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit\
vol3.txt:description. Every species of calamity and horror befell me. Among other\
vol3.txt:My sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay. In vain I\

vol3.txt:horrors which encompassed me. For another twenty-four hours it was\

vol3.txt:anticipative horror, lest the apparition might possibly be real, than\
vol3.txt:pitiable objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered.\

vol3.txt:indescribable state of weakness and horror, brought on by the wine,\
vol3.txt:the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually approaching horrors\

## Prototype: working demo

## Design the flow of the program

## How to use the script

## PDF format
