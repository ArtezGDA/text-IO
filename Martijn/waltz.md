Waltz Choreographer

My tool enables you to print a waltz choreography. Where the steps re printed that are steps you have to follow, besides that you wil see little icons, they mean the following:
/ right foot action

\ left foot action

-> facing center( facing center means:  your body is turned to the other side of the floor)

_ facing wall() your body is facing the wall

| your body is in the line of dance

Also where the font is bold you have to put an accent in the dance.

you install this tool by saving the code in the texteditor program and to save it as python, then you ask in the terminal: python
waltz choreographer.py then it should print the chroreography.
 
 My tool is designed for people who don't have a lot of time and work hard, when they have a bit of time they can use this tool to practise their dance moves. A little excersize when you worked behind the computer all day.
