## Concept
The concept of this project is to create a Stutter Machine. People become nervous and get difficulties when they have to present themselves and speak. And because of this they begin to stutter. Can a computer do the same. When a computer wants to tell you something is it possible that it have a difficult time telling you that? Will it stutter?

I want to make some sort of code where you could enter your own text and make it stutter. When you type text you get as output the same text but than with some stutter.

Input = your text //  Output =  generated stutter text with sound (text to voice)
